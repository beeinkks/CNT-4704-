Simple math calculator!

The client program repeatedly requires the user to input a basic math computing question, 
which will be sent to server program where it will be computed. The result is sent back by
the server program and the client program displays it out.

Math computing question has this format: “x op y =”, where x and y are positive real numbers, 
“op” represents basic math operator of “+”, “-“, “*”, “/” . The user ends the repeated input 
procedure by typing “0/0=”. If the user types in an invalid math question, the client should 
show an error message “Input error. Re-type the math question again.”

The server should output the math questions sent by the client, and show the end of client 
input when receiving “0/0=”, and then shut down.
